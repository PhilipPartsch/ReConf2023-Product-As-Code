Tools
=====

Here we collect binary tools which do not support code import.

Please pay attention, if you want to execute a tool in a pipeline, you have to set the execution bit for UNIX OS based systems.
| Please do so with:
| `git update-index --chmod=+x path/to/tool`

and normal git commit handling.
